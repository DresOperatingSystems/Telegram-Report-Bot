# Telegram-Report-Bot  

These are 2 bot scripts to be able to send reports about channels, groups and users to Telegram moderation in an effort to help keep the platform clean. Both scripts work in there own way, currently the second script does come with bugs that are being worked on at the moment so the script will be updated in the near future unless you're prepared to go through the debugging process yourself. 

The differences between the scripts is that with script 1 the bot has to be added to the channel or group chat and it does not support reporting user accounts, with script 2 the bot works as is with being able to report accounts, groups and channels so long as they're public. Both scripts are writ completely different to each other so the bot can handle it's intended purpose. Basically one script is for private and one for public.

GETTING STARTED:::::

First please go to @BotFather over on telegram and create a bot taking down the api key to then add into the scripts.

Secondly go into your terminal then copy and paste the steps below. 

git clone https://<i></i>github.com/DresOperatingSystems/Telegram-Report-Bot

cd Telegram-Report-Bot

pip install -r requirements.txt

nano Dresbanbotscript1.py (change the api token)

python Dresbanbot1.py

Obviously change the number of the script to the one you would like to use

Afterwards go into telegram go message your bot /start then begin the process of reporting 

TO DO LIST:::::
1}Add error handling
2}Debug script 2
3}Add exclusive chat id to the scripts
4}Run more tests
5}Add in bot support from the DresOS team

I am not responsible for any type of unethical use with these scripts also if used in any type of unethical way that breaks Telegrams ToS can lead to your account being terminated by them.

Thank You
